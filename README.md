# B2R2.FsReadLine

This is a GNU readline implementation written purely in F#, which is inspired by
[this project](https://github.com/tonerdo/readline).

Currently FsReadLine minimally supports command line history, automatic tab
completion, and several keyboard shortcuts. Thus, we are widely open for PRs.

To see what this library does, simply run the demo project:

``` bash
$ dotnet run --project src/FsReadLine.Demo
```
